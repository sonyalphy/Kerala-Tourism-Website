# Kerala-Tourism-Website
HelloðŸ‘‹

This is a small website that I built using Bootstrap and other basic components as part of my web development studies. Basically, this website provides information about different tourist places in Kerala and The user has the option to log in or sign up to their private accounts(no backend, just UI).
This work gave me very good exposure to the whole bootstrap framework and Web UI designing.

The requirements are as follows:
1. Login Page
2. SignUp Page
3. Home Page
4. District Page (Picture and Name of 14 districts as a link)
5. Any 5 Individual Page for each district (Picture, short description, 2-5 hot tourist spots with photos and name)

Things to Note:
* Total: 9 to 10 Pages
* Mandatory: HTML/CSS with Bootstrap
* Animations and other exciting features are an advantage.
* No need to do form validations now.
